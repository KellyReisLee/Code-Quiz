<h3>Description: </h3>
<p>This project is a quiz with some questions about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was developed using react.js.

There are some extra options, such as:
1. The 'Tip' button is for you to receive a tip about the answer.
2. The 'Excluir um' button eliminates an incorrect alternative.
3. You can not choose both or one or another to help you answer the questions.

NOTE: The design of this project was taken from a very good tutorial. Below is the link:
